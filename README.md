This project included quantitative survey of shoreline anglers throughout Milwaukee County to characterize various subgroups within the shoreline angling community, identify their preferences, motivations, and sources of information, and the preferred mechanisms to solicit input in policy processes from these stakeholders. We also conducted a policy analysis to determine if and how the diverse perspectives of shoreline anglers are incorporated into policy decisions. We surveyed Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources fisheries staff to understand their approaches to stakeholder engagement.  Then we compared the published policy documents to survey results from the cohort of shoreline anglers and DNR staff. 
We expected the results of these investigations to find that shoreline anglers in Milwaukee County represent a racially, socioeconomically, and educationally diverse community, with a variety of perspectives, motivations, and primary sources of information for fishing. We hypothesized that due to the lack of organizational representation in policymaking fora, shoreline anglersâ€™ interests and perspectives were not adequately incorporated into fisheries policy decisions. From this study, we aim to characterize shoreline angling communities, their characteristics, perspectives, and interests in fisheries management, and to recommend effective policy communication best practices that will allow for more diverse, equitable, and inclusive policymaking processes. This study provides a case study and model for natural resource management agencies to better understand and incorporate underrepresented stakeholder groups into policy decisions.
